# Salmon_ISM


This repository was created to make all the codes used in "Supervised machine learning is superior to indicator value inference to monitor environmental impact of salmon aquaculture using eDNA metabarcodes" by Fr√ºhe, Cordier, Dully, Breiner, Pawlowski, Martins, Wilding & Stoeck publicly available. 

In the file SML_Analysis.R you will find everything you need to run Supervised Machine Learning tests on our dataset. 
The accompanied file compo.txt is a metadatatable corresponding to the samples we used (see Ssupplementary Information 1 of the paper). 

In the file Code_manuscript.R all codes used to infer IndVals for ASVs are deposited, as well as all codes to retrieve ASVs 
from HTS data and for nonmetrical multidimensonal scaling plots.
